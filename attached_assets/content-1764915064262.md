### About Me

Hi, my name is Everest Yang, and I'm from Massachusetts. I am an undergrad student at Brown University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science (Tracks: AI/ML & Systems).


After graduating, I am planning to pursue a PhD in CS/Robotics. My interests range from Deep Learning to Surgical Robotics, Oncology, Aerospace, and more.


In my internship at AWS, I developed a Generative AI application with several AWS services (Bedrock, S3, Lambda, Athena, etc). At NASA, I worked on wireless networking infrastructure to establish Wi-Fi and cellular communication (3GPP) on the Moon.


In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, hiking, and trying new foods. Currently, I am also interested in learning more about fusion engineering, plasma physics, and philosophy!
